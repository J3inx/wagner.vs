currently developing a script that might be able to cheese some of shein's mobile crap games, just run the script, input your referral link, and hope for the best.
still a huge wip so dont expect anything yet

most recent updates:
the shein games only really working on the mobile
app. will keep working on it but useful for gettin
to websites using a proxy, still need to code the
bot itself and it's actions as well as move
dependancies from the venv to a local source
maybe use pip and a requirements page, works
almost as intended so far though
