# Python Shein/others Referall bot

[![Python 3.10+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads)

**huge work in progess, i dont know what i am doing**
currently developing a script that might be able to cheese some of shein's mobile crap games, just run the script, input your referral link, and hope for the best.
still a huge `wip` so dont expect anything yet

## usage in a clui
```bash
python3 testbot.py
```
from there it should just ask you:
```bash
Enter the URL you want to visit (including http:// or https://): 
```
>(been meaning to just auto put https:// but you have to do it manually)

happy cheating!
```python
insert stupid smily image here
```

most recent updates:
the shein games only really working on the mobile
app. will keep working on it but useful for gettin
to websites using a proxy, still need to code the
bot itself and it's actions as well as move
dependancies from the venv to a local source
maybe use pip and a requirements page, works
almost as intended so far though
